# mount



You can use **mount** to mount Network File System (NFS) network shares.

## Syntax

```
mount [-o <Option>[...]] [-u:<UserName>] [-p:{<Password> | *}] {\\<ComputerName>\<ShareName> | <ComputerName>:/<ShareName>} {<DeviceName> | *}
```

## Description

The **mount** command-line utility mounts the file system identified by *ShareName* exported by the NFS server identified by *ComputerName* and associates it with the drive letter specified by *DeviceName* or, if an asterisk (**&#42;**) is used, by the first available driver letter. Users can then access the exported file system as though it were a drive on the local computer. When used without options or arguments, **mount** displays information about all mounted NFS file systems.

The **mount** utility is available only if Client for NFS is installed.

The following options and arguments can be used with the **mount** utility.

|Term|Definition|
|----|----------|
|-o rsize=\<buffersize>|Sets the size in kilobytes of the read buffer. Acceptable values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32; the default is 32 KB.|
|-o wsize=\<buffersize>|Sets the size in kilobytes of the write buffer. Acceptable values are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32; the default is 32 KB.|
|-o timeout=\<seconds>|Sets the time-out value in seconds for a remote procedure call (RPC). Acceptable values are 0.8, 0.9, and any integer in the range 1-60; the default is 0.8.|
|-o retry=\<number>|Sets the number of retries for a soft mount. Acceptable values are integers in the range 1-10; the default is 1.|
|-o mtype={soft | hard}|Sets the mount type (default is **soft**). Regardless of the mount type, **mount** will return if it cannot immediately mount the share. Once the share has been successfully mounted, however, if the mount type is **hard**, Client for NFS will continue to try to access the share until it is successful. As a result, if the NFS server is unavailable, any Windows program trying to access the share will appear to stop responding, or "hang," if the mount type is **hard**.|
|-o anon|Mounts as an anonymous user.|
|-o nolock|Disables locking (default is **enabled**).|
|-o casesensitive|Forces file lookups on the server to be case sensitive.|
|-o fileaccess=\<mode>|Specifies the default permission mode of new files created on the NFS share. Specify *mode* as a three-digit number in the form *ogw*, where *o*, *g*, and *w* are each a digit representing the access granted the file's owner, group, and the world, respectively. The digits must be in the range 0-7 with the following meaning:</br>-   0: No access</br>-   1: x (execute access)</br>-   2: w (write access)</br>-   3: wx</br>-   4: r (read access)</br>-   5: rx</br>-   6: rw</br>-   7: rwx|
|-o lang={euc-jp|euc-tw|euc-kr|shift-jis|big5|ksc5601|gb2312-80|ansi}|Specifies the default encoding used for file and directory names and, if used, must be set to one of the following:</br>-   **ansi**</br>-   **big5** (Chinese)</br>-   **euc-jp** (Japanese)</br>-   **euc-kr** (Korean)</br>-   **euc-tw** (Chinese)</br>-   **gb2312-80** (Simplified Chinese)</br>-   **ksc5601** (Korean)</br>-   **shift-jis** (Japanese)</br>If this option is set to **ansi** on systems configured for non-English locales, the encoding scheme is set to the default encoding scheme for the locale. The following are the default encoding schemes for the indicated locales:</br>-   Japanese: SHIFT-JIS</br>-   Korean: KS_C_5601-1987</br>-   Simplified Chinese: GB2312-80</br>-   Traditional Chinese: BIG5|
|-u:\<UserName>|Specifies the user name to use for mounting the share. If *username* is not preceded by a backslash (**\**), it is treated as a UNIX user name.|
|-p:\<Password>|The password to use for mounting the share. If you use an asterisk (**&#42;**), you will be prompted for the password.|
