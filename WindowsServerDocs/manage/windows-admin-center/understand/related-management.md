# Windows Admin Center and related management solutions from Microsoft

>Applies To: Windows Admin Center, Windows Admin Center Preview

[Windows Admin Center](windows-admin-center.md) is the evolution of traditional in-box server management tools for situations where you might have used Remote Desktop (RDP) to connect to a server for troubleshooting or configuration. It's not intended to replace other existing Microsoft management solutions; rather it complements these solutions, as described below.

## Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)

[Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2693643/remote-server-administration-tools-rsat-for-windows-operating-systems) is a collection of GUI and PowerShell tools to manage optional roles and features in Windows Server. RSAT has many capabilities that Windows Admin Center doesn't have. We may add some of the most commonly used tools in RSAT to Windows Admin Center in the future. Any new Windows Server role or feature that requires a GUI for management will be in Windows Admin Center.

## System Center

[System Center](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/system-center) is an on-premises data center management solution for deployment, configuration, management, monitoring your entire data center. System Center lets you see the status of all the systems in your environment, while Windows Admin Center lets you drill down into a specific server to manage or troubleshoot it with more granular tools.

## Intune

[Intune](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/microsoft-intune) is a cloud-based enterprise mobility management service that lets you manage iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS devices, based on a set of policies. Intune focuses on enabling you to secure company information by controlling how your workforce accesses and shares information. In contrast, Windows Admin Center is not policy-driven, but enables ad-hoc management of Windows 10 and Windows Server systems, using remote PowerShell and WMI over WinRM.

## Azure Stack

[Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack/) is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you deliver Azure services from your data center. Azure Stack is managed using PowerShell or the administrator portal, which is similar to the traditional Azure portal used to access and manage traditional Azure services. Windows Admin Center isn't intended to manage the Azure Stack infrastructure, but you can use it to [manage Azure IaaS virtual machines](../configure/manage-azure-vms.md) (running Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows Server 2012) or troubleshoot individual physical servers deployed in your Azure Stack environment.
