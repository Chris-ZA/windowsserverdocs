      <para>The 8606 error is logged when a source domain controller sends an update to an object (instead of an originating object create) that was already created, deleted, and reclaimed by garbage collection from the copy of Active Directory on a destination domain controller <placeholder>and</placeholder> the destination domain controller was configured to run in <externalLink><linkText>strict replication consistency</linkText><linkUri>https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc816938(WS.10).aspx</linkUri></externalLink>. 
</para>
      <para>If the destination domain controller was configured to use loose replication consistency, the object would instead be "reanimated" on the copy of Active Directory on the destination domain controller. Specific variations that can cause the 8606 error are documented in the "More Information" section. However, the error is caused by one of the following:</para>
      <list class="bullet">
        <listItem>
          <para>A permanently lingering object whose removal will require administrative intervention.</para>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>A transient lingering object that will correct itself when the source domain controller performs its next garbage-collection cleanup. The introduction of the first Windows Server 2008 R2 domain controller in an existing forest and updates to the partial attribute set are known causes of this condition.</para>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>An object that was undeleted or restored at the cusp of tombstone lifetime expiration.</para>

      </list>
      <para>
Remember the following when you troubleshoot 8606 errors: </para>
      <list class="bullet">
        <listItem>
          <para>Even though the 8606 error is logged on the destination domain controller, the problem object that is blocking replication resides on the source domain controller. Additionally, the source domain controller or a transitive replication partner of the source domain controller potentially <?Comment JTH: Ask Arren. 2012-02-22T15:14:00Z  Id='0?>did not inbound-replicate knowledge of a deleted tombstone life number of days in the past.<?CommentEnd Id='0'
    ?></para>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>Lingering objects may exist under the following circumstances:</para>
          <list class="ordered">
            <listItem>
              <para>As "live" objects, as CNF or conflict-mangled objects "live" objects, or as CNF or conflict-mangled objects in the deleted objects container of the source domain controller.</para>
            </listItem>
            <listItem>
              <para>In any directory partition including application partitions <placeholder>except</placeholder> the schema partition. The schema partition does not support deletes.</para>
            </listItem>
            <listItem>
              <para>In any object class (users, computers, groups, and DNS records are most common). Lingering objects are most frequently found in read-only domain partitions on GCs and in writable domains and may also be found in the configuration partition.</para>
            </listItem>
          </list>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>Remember to search for potentially lingering objects by object GUID vs. DN path so that objects can be found regardless of their host partition and parent container. Searching by objectguid will also locate objects that are in the deleted objects container without using the deleted objects LDAP control.</para>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>The NTDS Replication 1988 event identifies only the current object on the source domain controller that is blocking incoming replication by a strict mode destination domain controller. Additional lingering object updates are likely in the replication queue "behind" the object that is referenced in the 1988 event.</para>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>The presence of lingering objects on a source domain controller prevents or blocks strict mode destination domain controllers from inbound-replicating "good" changes that exist behind the lingering object in the replication queue.</para>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>Because of the way that domain controllers individually delete objects from their deleted object containers (the garbage-collection daemon runs every 12 hours from the last time each domain controller last started), the objects that are causing 8606 errors on destination domain controllers <placeholder>could</placeholder> be subject to removal in the next garbage-collection cleanup execution. Lingering objects in this class are transient and should remove themselves in no more than 12 hours from problem start.</para>
        </listItem>
        <listItem>
          <para>The lingering object in question is likely one that was intentionally deleted by an administrator or application. Factor this into your resolution plan, and beware of reanimating objects, especially security principals that were intentionally deleted.</para>

          <para>The date stamps for <embeddedLabel>LastKnownParent</embeddedLabel> and <embeddedLabel>IsDeleted</embeddedLabel> columns can be determined by running "repadmin /showobjmeta" and referencing the objectguid of the object that is cited in the NTDS replication 1988 event.

          <code>c:&gt;repadmin /showobjmeta &lt;fqdn of source DC from 1988 event&gt; "&lt;GUID=GUID of object cited in the 1988 event&gt;" </code>
          <para>The date stamp for <embeddedLabel>LastKnownParent</embeddedLabel> identifies the date on which the object was deleted. The date stamp for <embeddedLabel>IsDeleted</embeddedLabel> tells you when the object was last deleted or reanimated. The version number tells you whether the last modification deleted or reanimated the object. An <embeddedLabel>IsDeleted</embeddedLabel> value of 1 represents an initial delete. Odd-numbered values greater than 1 indicate a reanimation following at least one deletion. For example, an <embeddedLabel>IsDeleted</embeddedLabel> value of 2 represents an object that was deleted (version 1) and then later undeleted or reanimated (version 2). Later even-numbered values for <embeddedLabel>IsDeleted</embeddedLabel> represent later reanimations or undeletes of the object.</para>

          <para>If error 8606 / Event 1988 was caused by the domain controller's failing to replicate Active Directory changes in the last tombstone lifetime number of days, make sure that Active Directory replication health is being monitored on a day-to-day basis going forward. Replication health may be monitored by using a dedicated monitoring application or by viewing the output from the one inexpensive but effective option to run "repadmin /showrepl * /csv" command in a spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Excel. (See "Method 2: Monitor replication by using a command-line" in Microsoft Knowledge Base article <externalLink><linkText>910205</linkText><linkUri>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/910205</linkUri></externalLink>).
</para>
          <para>
Domain controllers that have not inbound-replicated in 50 percent of tombstone lifetime number of days should be put in a watch list that receive priority admin attention to make replication operational. Domain controllers that cannot be made to successfully replicate should be force-demoted if they have not replicated within 90 percent of tombstone lifetime (TSL).
</para>
          <para>
Replication failures that appear on a destination domain controller may be caused by the destination domain controller, by the source domain controller, or by the underlying network and DNS infrastructure.</para>

        <title>Cause 1: The source domain controller sends updates to objects that have already been reclaimed by garbage collection on the destination domain controller because the source domain controller either was offline or has failed replication for TSL elapsed number of days.</title>
        <content>
          <para>The CONTOSO.COM domain contains two domain controllers in the same domain. Tombstone lifetime equals 60 days. Strict replication is enabled on both domain controllers. DC2 experiences a motherboard failure. Meanwhile, DC1 makes originating deletes for stale security groups daily over the next 90 days. After it is offline for 90 days, DC2 receives a replacement motherboard, powers up, and then originates an ACL change on all user accounts <placeholder>before</placeholder> it inbound-replicates knowledge of originating deletes from DC1. DC1 logs 8606 errors for updates security groups that are purged on DC1 for the first 30 days that DC2 was offline.</para>
        </content>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Cause 2: The Source DC sends updates to objects at the cusp of TSL expiration that have already been reclaimed by garbage collection by a strict mode destination DC.</title>
        <content>
          <para>The CONTOSO.COM domain contains two domain controllers in the same domain. Tombstone lifetime equals 60 days. Strict replication is enabled on both domain controllers. DC1 and DC2 replicate every 24 hours. DC1 originates deletes daily. DC1 is in-place upgraded to <token>nextref_server_includes>. This stamps new attributes on all objects in the configuration and writable domain partitions. This includes objects that are currently in the deleted objects container, some of which were deleted 60 days ago and are now at the cusp of tombstone expiration. DC2 reclaims some objects by garbage collection that were deleted TSL days ago before the replication schedule opens with DC2. Error 8606 is logged until DC1 reclaims the blocking objects by garbage collection.
</para>
          <para>
Any updates to the partial attribute set can cause temporary lingering objects that will clear themselves up after source domain controllers garbage-collect deleted objects at the cusp of TSL expiration (for example, the addition of the first <token>nextref_server_includes> domain controller to an existing forest).</para>
        </content>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Cause 3: A time jump on a destination domain controller prematurely speeds up the garbage collection of deleted objects on a destination domain controller.</title>
        <content>
          <para>The CONTOSO.COM domain contains two domain controllers in the same domain. Tombstone lifetime equals 60 days. Strict replication is enabled on both domain controllers. DC1 and DC2 replicate every 24 hours. DC1 originates deletes daily. The reference time source that is used by DC1 (but not DC2) rolls forward to calendar year 2039. This causes DC2 to also adopt a system time in calendar year 2039. This causes DC1 to prematurely delete objects that are deleted today from its deleted objects container. Meanwhile, DC2 originates changes to attributes on users, computers, and groups that are live on DC2 but deleted and now prematurely garbage collected on DC1. DC1 will log error 8606 when it next inbound-replicates changes for the premature deleted objects.</para>

        <title>Cause 4: An object is reanimated at the cusp of TSL expiration</title>
        <content>
          <para>The CONTOSO.COM domain contains two domain controllers in the same domain. Tombstone lifetime equals 60 days. Strict replication is enabled on both domain controllers. DC1 and DC2 replicate every 24 hours. DC1 originates deletes daily. An OU that contains users, computers, and groups is accidentally deleted. A system state backup that is made at the cusp of TSL in the past is auth-restored on DC2. The backup contains objects that are live on DC2 but already deleted and reclaimed by garbage collection on DC1.</para>

        <title>Cause 5: A USN bubble is triggered the logging of the 8606</title>
        <content>
          <para>Suppose you create an object in a USN bubble in such a way that it does not outbound-replicate because the destination domain controller "thinks" it has the object because of the bubble. Now, after the bubble closes, and after changes start to replicate again, a change is created for that object on the source domain controller and is displayed as a lingering object to the destination domain controller. The destination controller logs the 8606 event.</para>

        <title>Requirements for end-to-end replicate knowledge of originating deletes</title>
        <content>
          <para>Active Directory domain controllers support multi-master replication where any domain controller (holding a writable partition) can originate a create, change, or delete of an object or attribute (value). Knowledge of object/attribute deletes are persisted by the originating domain controller and any domain controller that has incoming replicated knowledge of an originating delete for TSL number of days. (See Microsoft Knowledge Base articles <externalLink><linkText>216996</linkText><linkUri>https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;216993</linkUri></externalLink> and <externalLink><linkText>910205</linkText><linkUri>https://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;910205</linkUri></externalLink>)
</para>
          <para>
Active Directory requires end-to-end replication from all partition holders to transitively replicate all originating deletes for all directory partitions to all partition holders. Failure to inbound-replicate a directory partition in a rolling TSL numbers of days results in lingering objects. A lingering object is an object that was intentionally deleted by at least one domain controller but that incorrectly exists on destination domain controllers that did not inbound-replicate the transient knowledge of all unique deletions.</para>
