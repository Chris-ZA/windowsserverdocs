  <introduction>
    <para>This problem typically occurs when an attempt to establish a replication link fails as a result of a Domain Name System (DNS) lookup problem. If you receive Event ID 1925 with the error message that DNS lookup failed, inbound replication of a directory partition has failed on the destination domain controller, and you must fix the DNS problem. </para>
    <para>The following is an example of the event text: </para>
    <code>Log Name: Directory Service
Source: Microsoft-Windows-ActiveDirectory_DomainService
Date: 3/12/2008  8:14:13 AM
Event ID: 1925
Task Category: Knowledge Consistency Checker 
Level: Warning
Keywords: Classic
User: ANONYMOUS LOGON
Computer: DC3.contoso.com
Description:
The attempt to establish a replication link for the following 
writable directory partition failed. 

Directory partition: 
CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com 
Source directory service: 
CN=NTDS Settings,CN=DC1,CN=Servers,CN=Default-First-Site-Name,
CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com 
Source domain controller address: 
f8786828-ecf5-4b7d-ad12-8ab60178f7cd._msdcs.contoso.com 
Intersite transport (if any): CN=IP,CN=Inter-Site Transports,
CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=constoso,DC=com

This domain controller will be unable to replicate with the 
source domain controller until this problem is corrected.
