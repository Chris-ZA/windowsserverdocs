# Remote Desktop Services - planning poster

## Remote Desktop modern infrastructure
Did you hear about the new Remote Desktop modern infrastructure? If not, you've got to check out Scott Manchester's post and video, [Remote Desktop Services: Updates & upcoming innovations](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2017/09/20/first-look-at-updates-coming-to-remote-desktop-services/). The new modern infrastructure (sometimes called "RDmi") is currently in private preview. 

The following poster shows how you can plan for and deploy the modern infrastructure.
